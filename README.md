# HR-and-Sales-Adventure-Data-Analysis
An extensive analysis project involving data manipulation using Sql and Insight visualization using Excel.

# Overview
This project leveraged the AdventureWorks 2016 schema to explore business insights from both Sales and HR perspectives.
Using SQL, I performed several joins across various tables such as SalesOrderHeader, Employee, and Products, ultimately creating two clean, analysis-ready datasets.
A Hr dataset and a Sales Dataset.The focus was on identifying trends in sales performance and assess company workforce distribution.

# SQL Flow chart
I started by joining the key tables and creating temporary tables to efficiently structure the data. Once the results were optimized and cleaned, 
the temporary tables were converted into permanent ones, ready for export and further analysis:

# Excel Analysis
Each dataset was analyzed independently, providing insights into the organization's workforce and sales.
A key challenge in the sales analysis was normalizing the product names to achieve First Normal Form (1NF), as the product entries were not standardized.
Trends from both datasets were explored using pivot tables, then visualized and compiled into interactive dashboards.
